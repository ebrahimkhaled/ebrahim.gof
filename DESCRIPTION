Description: Implements the Ebrahim-Farrington goodness-of-fit test for logistic 
    regression models, particularly effective for sparse data and binary outcomes. 
    This test provides an improved alternative to the traditional Hosmer-Lemeshow 
    test by using a modified Pearson chi-square statistic with data-dependent 
    grouping. The test is based on Farrington's (1996) theoretical framework but 
    simplified for practical implementation with binary data. Includes functions 
    for both the original Farrington test (for grouped data) and the new 
    Ebrahim-Farrington test (for binary data with automatic grouping).
